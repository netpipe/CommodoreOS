; RAM Disk Demo - Example RAM Disk Implementation in 6502 Assembly
; This is a simplified demonstration of a RAM disk in assembly.

; Include necessary constants or headers here if needed.

.org $0801  ; Set the assembly address for BASIC startup
    .byte $0C, $08 ; SYS $080C

.org $0803  ; Set the assembly address for your program
main:
    ; Initialize RAM disk here

    ; Your RAM disk implementation code goes here

    ; Example: Create a file
    JSR createFile

    ; Example: Read from a file
    JSR readFile

    ; Example: Write to a file
    JSR writeFile

    ; Example: Delete a file
    JSR deleteFile

    ; Your RAM disk demo continues here

    ; Wait for key press to exit
    JSR $FFE4

    ; Return to BASIC
    RTS

; Define your RAM disk data structures and functions here

; Example: Function to create a file
createFile:
    ; Your create file code here
    RTS

; Example: Function to read from a file
readFile:
    ; Your read file code here
    RTS

; Example: Function to write to a file
writeFile:
    ; Your write file code here
    RTS

; Example: Function to delete a file
deleteFile:
    ; Your delete file code here
    RTS

; End of file
